I am a simple frontend developer. With over 15 years of experience in designing, developing and producing web interfaces, you might say I’ve seen some stuff. I started building websites with `<table>`s, then `float`s and now with `flex` and `grid`. Even after all these years in the field, I’m still excited about all the things you can do with and on the interwebs. 

I love helping clients establish their online presence and help them reach and communicate with their  customers more easily. After that, I test, analyse and improve everything.  Also I help designer and developer teams come up with design systems that serve as single source of truth so that developing new features is faster and easier.

Currently, I’m working as frontend developer at [Vivify Ideas](https://vivifyideas.com "Vivify Ideas") and I’m a teacher at [Vivify Academy](https://academy.vivifyideas.com "Vivify Academy"). There I work with startups, medium and large companies helping them bring their ideas to life. At our Academy, I created curriculum and I teach basics of aesthetics, design and more importantly, HTML and CSS.

Sometimes I dream about writing about all the cool and weird stuff that I think about like design systems, empathy, good interfaces and design practices. That’s one of the main reasons I started this site, blog or whatever you want to call it. Feel free to let me know how bad I am doing, I won’t mind.
